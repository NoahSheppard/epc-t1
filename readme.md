# FallSView

## About
FallsView is a website aimed to give all an interactive view and experience of Oxford Falls Grammar. 

After seeing the current solution for this, I decided change needed to happen - this cannot be the best the school has to offer. Hence, I decided to work on this

## Browser Compatibility
Since FallsView is built off of Pannellum (which is built with web standards), it requires a modern browser to function.

#### Full support (from Pannellum docs):
* Firefox 23+
* Chrome 24+
* Safari 8+
* Internet Explorer 11+
* Edge

The support list is based on feature support. As only recent browsers are tested, there may be regressions in older browsers.
